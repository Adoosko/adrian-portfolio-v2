    "description": "My name is Adrian Finik and I come from Orava. My programming journey began in my first year of high school, when out of curiosity I started with the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Every new line of code pushed me forward, and I soon discovered more advanced technologies like React and Next.js, which completely absorbed me. Today, in 2025, Next.js is my main platform, where I develop modern websites daily and am extremely satisfied with it.\n\nMy experience is no longer just in school projects – I have worked on real assignments where I also tried full-stack development and confirmed that modern technologies like Prisma ORM or animations with Framer Motion have a firm place in today's world. In addition to working on the client side of the web, I like to experiment with my own projects, where I am not afraid to try new trends and push my boundaries.\n\nI believe that we live in 2025 and it is time to use the technologies that define this year. I try to keep up with the times, innovate, and create websites that are not only functional but also visually attractive and modern. Because only in this way can we move the digital world forward.",
