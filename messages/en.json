    "description": "Hello! I'm Adrian, a web developer passionate about creating digital experiences that live at the intersection of design and technology. My journey started back in 2019 when I decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes — turns out hacking together a custom reblog button taught me a lot about HTML & CSS! Fast-forward to today, and I've had the privilege of working at minimalistic.studio, where I focus on building accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences for a variety of clients. I enjoy working at the intersection of design and development, creating products that are not only functional but also provide meaningful user experiences. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open source projects, or sharing knowledge with the developer community.",
